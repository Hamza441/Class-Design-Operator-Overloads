# Class-Design-Operator-Overloads
Purpose
This programming assignment will provide exercises in designing classes with proper abstraction and encapsulation. Encapsulation and abstraction are key components of the C++ programming language as well as OOP in general. In addition, the programming assignment will require understanding of operator overloading.
Problem 1: The Vending Bank

You only need to design the contract (.h file) and not the implementation (.cpp file). Here is a start of vending_bank.h with one function already defined. The data member id_ is a unique identifier for the vending bank.
